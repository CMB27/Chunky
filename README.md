# Chunky
A chunky console font for screens that have trouble rendering thin lines

The font was designed using FontForge, and then exported as a .bdf file.
The .bdf file was converted to a .psf file using bdf2psf.
I designed this for use with a Rasbperry Pi without a gui on a small composite video screen.
